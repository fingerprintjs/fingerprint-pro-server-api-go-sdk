// Proximity ID represents a fixed geographical zone in a discrete global grid within which the device is observed.
type WebhookProximity struct {
	// A stable privacy-preserving identifier for a given proximity zone.
	Id string `json:"id"`
	// The radius of the proximity zoneâ€™s precision level, in meters.
	PrecisionRadius int32 `json:"precisionRadius"`
	// A value between `0` and `1` representing the likelihood that the true device location lies within the mapped proximity zone.   * Scores closer to `1` indicate high confidence that the location is inside the mapped proximity zone.   * Scores closer to `0` indicate lower confidence, suggesting the true location may fall in an adjacent zone.
