// Sums key data points for a specific `visitorId` at three distinct time intervals: 5 minutes, 1 hour, and 24 hours as follows:  - Number of identification events attributed to the visitor ID - Number of distinct IP addresses associated to the visitor ID. - Number of distinct countries associated with the visitor ID. - Number of distinct `linkedId`s associated with the visitor ID. The `24h` interval of `distinctIp`, `distinctLinkedId`, and `distinctCountry` will be omitted if the number of `events` for the visitor ID in the last 24 hours (`events.intervals.['24h']`) is higher than 20.000.
type VelocityResult struct {
	DistinctIp       *VelocityIntervals `json:"distinctIp"`
	DistinctLinkedId *VelocityIntervals `json:"distinctLinkedId"`
	DistinctCountry  *VelocityIntervals `json:"distinctCountry"`
	Events           *VelocityIntervals `json:"events"`
